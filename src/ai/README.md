# AI Agent Layer

This directory contains the core logic for the various AI agents that power the advanced quiz system. Each agent has a specific responsibility, from generating content to evaluating user answers.

This follows the multi-agent design described in the project plan.

## Agents:
- **Content Agent:** Generates new questions.
- **Difficulty Agent:** Assesses and assigns difficulty to questions.
- **Hint Agent:** Provides hints for questions.
- **Explainer Agent:** Explains correct/incorrect answers.
- **Teacher Agent:** Assists teachers with creating and managing quizzes.
- **Evaluator Agent:** Grades open-ended and complex responses.
